# Light Display

This application was built in response to a simple coding challenge proposed in [this repository](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Christmas-Lights-App.md)

The ChristmasLights application relies on your development talents to create
a mesmerizing light display. Your task is to draw seven colored circles
in a row and based on a timer change the intensity of each circle. When
a circle is brightened it's predecessor returns to its normal intensity.

This simulates the effect of a string of rippling lights, similar to the ones
displayed during the Christmas Holidays.
